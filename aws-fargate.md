* When we create an ECSÂ cluster, we have to launch EC2 instances.
* If we need to scale, we have to add EC2 instances.  
* So we manage infrastructure.
* With Fargate, it's all serverless.
* We don't provision EC2 instances.
* We just create a task definition. AWS will run a container for us.
* To scale, just increase the number of tasks, no more EC2 instances.
